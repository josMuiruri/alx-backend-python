0x00. Python - Variable Annotations
Learning Objectives
General
At the end of this project, am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

Type annotations in Python 3
How I can use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
Duck typing
How to validate my code with mypy
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
All my files should end with a new line
The first line of all my files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.)
All my files must be executable
The length of my files will be tested using wc
All my modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All my classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All my functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
